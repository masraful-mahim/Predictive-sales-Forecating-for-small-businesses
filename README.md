# Predictive Sales Forecasting for Small Businesses

This project provides a predictive sales forecasting tool for small businesses using the **Prophet** and **ARIMA** models. It includes a **Dash** dashboard for visualizing historical sales, forecasts, anomalies, and category-specific trends. The tool is designed to help small businesses make data-driven decisions by forecasting future sales based on historical data.

## Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Uses Prophet and ARIMA to predict future sales.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outliers in sales data using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Dash and Plotly for visualizing daily sales, forecasts, and category-specific trends.
- **Category-Specific Forecasts**: Provides forecasts for individual product categories.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Allows users to download forecast results and summary reports in CSV and PDF formats.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.6 or higher**: The project is built using Python.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/masrafiul-mahin/predictive-sales-forecasting.git
cd predictive-sales-forecasting
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. Use Python’s built-in `venv` module to create and activate a virtual environment.

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, you’ll see the virtual environment name (e.g., `(.venv)`) in your terminal prompt.

### 3. Install Required Libraries
Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### List of Required Libraries
The project depends on the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `holidays`: To add US holidays as features for forecasting.
- `prophet`: For time series forecasting using the Prophet model.
- `statsmodels`: For ARIMA model implementation.
- `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`): For calculating metrics like RMSE.
- `plotly`: For creating interactive visualizations.
- `dash`: For building the interactive web dashboard.
- `reportlab`: For generating PDF reports.

These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which is automatically generated using `pip freeze`.

### 4. Add the Dataset
The dataset (`Sales Dataset.csv`) is not included in this repository due to size constraints. You need to add your own dataset to the project directory:
- Place the `Sales Dataset.csv` file in the `predictive-sales-forecasting` directory.
- Ensure the dataset has the following columns: `Order ID`, `Amount`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `PaymentMode`, `Order Date`, `CustomerName`, `State`, `City`, `Year-Month`.
- If your dataset is located elsewhere, update the file path in `forecast.py` (line 37):
  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv(r"path/to/your/Sales Dataset.csv")
  ```

## Usage
1. **Ensure the Virtual Environment is Activated**:
   If you haven’t already activated the virtual environment, do so:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Run the `forecast.py` script to start the Dash dashboard:
   ```bash
   python forecast.py
   ```
   - The script will preprocess the data, train the Prophet and ARIMA models, and launch a web server.
   - You’ll see a message like:
     ```
     Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
     ```
   - Open the URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8050/`) in your web browser to access the dashboard.

3. **Interact with the Dashboard**:
   - **Daily Sales Over Time**: View historical sales with anomaly detection.
   - **Total Sales by Category**: Analyze sales by product category, with an option to filter by state.
   - **Forecast vs Actual**: Compare actual sales with Prophet and ARIMA forecasts.
   - **Future Sales Forecast**: View a 30-day sales forecast with confidence intervals.
   - **Category-Specific Forecasts**: Explore forecasts for individual product categories.
   - **Download Options**: Download forecasts and reports as CSV or PDF files.
